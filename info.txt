Morgan package helps us to log the info about the request during development 

Alernative Approach : We use the validator package to validate the email address

COOKIES:
1) We are using the cookies to store jwt token.
2) Only the browser can access the token using cookie
3) We use the cookie-parser and it set the cookies send by the browser in the req.cookies obj
4) If we use signed in utils we need to specify it in the middleware and the cookies are in req.signedCookies

POPULATE METHOD:
1) We can get the information about the product or user with id
2) We need to use the .populate method in the review or any controller

MONGOOSE VIRTUALS:
1) They are properties that don't exist or not stored but used logically
2) toJSON: { virtuals: true }, toObject: { virtuals: true } }) in Product model
3) Create the ProductSchema.virtual('')

The reason for using product.remove() is that we can remove all the reviews associated with the product

AGGREGATE PIPELINES:
1) Go to Aggregation in Atlas 
2) Select the $match property
3) In the query use the "product":ObjectId('')
4) Add the Stage and select $group property
5) Add the id: and create the fields
Ex.{
  _id: null,
  averageRating: {$avg: "$rating"},
  numOfReviews: {$sum : 1}
}
